Friends had mentioned conversations Leroy had with Madelyn's rival.\n9. Winston also knew from his sources, she had been in the vicinity when Leroy was on the phone discussing the change.\n10. Madelyn had a reputation of changing her hair practically every week.\n11. A confirmed fact when Winston had visited her residential premises discovering several multi-colored wigs.\n12. Not wasting any time, Winston approached Madelyn after her demonstration.\n13. Madelyn agreed to go to the local coffee shop for a friendly chat.\n14. After a sputtered start, Winston was able to get Madelyn talking about her martial arts training, including the sai technique she used in her demonstration.\n15. A technique he knew was the cause of Leroy's death.\n16. Her unique weapon choice hadn't really surprised him. Given the dimension of martial arts Madelyn specialized in, he suspected the sai came from her collection.\n17. A trip to the local martial arts store had led him to a store owner who confirmed her recent purchase of a pair.\n18. As well, the owner remembered seeing Madelyn practicing with her new acquisition at a local gym.\n19. Eventually, Winston brought up the subject of passports. He'd found an interesting assortment of passports in various names inside a filing cabinet at Madelyn's house.\n20. He recalled her flustered behavior earlier at the post office where she'd been spotted getting passport photos taken.\n21. She struggled to explain, her face blanching at what he might uncover.\n22. The conversation ended on a note of betrayal, with Madelyn softly admitting her inner circle betrayals.\n23. Winston gathered the facts in his mind, of hair wigs, martial arts and betrayal.\n24. Whisking the rest of his untouched coffee, he left Madelyn at the table, lost in her own world of memories.\n25. Yet Winston had a murder inquiry to solve and no amount of color-changing wigs or phony passports could disguise that fact.\n26. He walked away with a nod, thinking of the next steps he would take before approaching Madelyn again.\n27. Irrespective of what she chose to conceal, he believed in the truth unveiling itself, the truth of a victim named Leroy.\n\nFinal Answer: A. Clayton"
