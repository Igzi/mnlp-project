    "output": "1. We know that Meredith is the suspect in the murder of Frances, but she is not the most likely murderer because she is a pet groomer and not a known killer.\n2. Kinsley is the enigmatic spiritual guru who is the most likely murderer because she is the one who led Frances' spiritual group into the rainforest and later disappeared, and she is also the one who kept a shotgun for self-protection.\n3. The shotgun found in the murder scene is registered to Kinsley, which suggests that she is the most likely murderer.\n4. Kinsley's group had recently acknowledged connections between her group and the local gang, which further supports the idea that she is the most likely murderer.\n5. Kinsley's group had chosen to conduct their spiritual meeting in the rainforest on the very same day Frances was killed, which adds to the suspicion that she is the most likely murderer.\n\nFinal Answer: B.
